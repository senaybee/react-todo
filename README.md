This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# A React todo list app
This is a cool little app i made with create-react-app. It allows for dynamic behaviour such as adding,
deleting, and crossing off items off the list. An action bar also allows people to filter the list.

The state of the app includes a list of objects meant to represent todos, the value of the input form, and 
a flag for which items to show. The state lives in the TodoApp components and event handlers are passed down
to child components and elements to change state.
